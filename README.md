Positional Privacy Protection Mobile Application System Overview

With the continuous advancement of smart spaces, ubiquitous computing devices and wireless sensor networks are assisting people in achieving tasks and goals, thereby enriching their lives. These devices often come equipped with high-precision location capabilities, such as those based on GPS receivers or triangulation with nearby base stations or access points. Most services function effectively by requiring users to provide sensitive and private location data. As people use sensors and smart devices more frequently, they reap immense conveniences but also leave nearly indelible digital traces. These traces, beyond mere geographical coordinates, convey ample information about personal habits, interests, activities, and relationships, potentially revealing personal or corporate secrets. Exposure of private information could subject users to myriad advertisements, location-based spam/scams, reputational or financial harm, and in severe cases, make them victims of extortion or even physical violence. Hence, ensuring the privacy of user trajectories is of paramount importance.

Given the varied privacy protection needs across user demographics, our project's design philosophy revolves around two main directions: 1. Determine the level of privacy protection strength based on user information and preferences. 2. Design privacy protection algorithms of varying strengths. Different types of users (students, employees) using different services (navigation, search) at different times (day, night) require different levels of privacy protection. For instance, a student's trajectory protection intensity when going to school would be less than when on a date. We've designed computation methods and algorithms rooted in decision-making and classification to calculate and relay a suitable privacy protection intensity back to the user.

Our selected trajectory protection algorithms primarily fall into three categories: 1. Suppression-based protection. 2. Fake trajectory protection. 3. Generalization-based protection. Suppression-based methods safeguard privacy by concealing sensitive locations in the published trajectory data. Although simple, this method can lead to data loss and may not always be suitable. Fake trajectory protection introduces deceptive paths into the original trajectory, thereby mitigating risks of leakage. Given that user visits to POIs (Points of Interest) are highly probable, we leverage POIs to replace some points in the original trajectory. This not only decreases the risk of leakage but also boosts the credibility of the fake trajectory. Among generalization methods, the most prevalent is the trajectory k-anonymity method. By constructing an anonymous set from k trajectories and reconstructing one trajectory from this set, the likelihood of an attacker succeeding is kept below 1/k. Moreover, because these k trajectories are atomic, the data utility of the published trajectory is enhanced.

Capitalizing on the above design principles, our team has developed a Privacy Protection App and toolkit. The app offers a user-friendly interface, allowing users to input relevant information and desired privacy protection levels. Via an API, the app communicates this data to the privacy protection tool which, upon leveraging the pertinent algorithm, determines the optimal privacy protection level and relays it back to the app. The app, based on this received privacy protection intensity, employs the appropriate location privacy protection algorithm. Using Xposed injection technology, the app injects fake trajectories and locations into the relevant location software, obfuscating the user's actual position and trajectory.

Currently, our software has undergone internal testing. We tested over 200 different paths and positions using 100 people's phones. The results indicate our software's real-time performance is commendable, rapidly adapting to changes in user location and effectively concealing actual user location and trajectory.

Our product aims to serve all users of smart devices in need of location privacy protection. By installing our software on your smartphone, we offer robust privacy protection, safeguarding your positional integrity and privacy. We're working diligently to launch the app on the Android marketplace, hoping to achieve widespread adoption. We anticipate at least tens of millions in market demand. Numerous apps on the market offer location services, and user demands for privacy protection are ever-increasing. Our software endeavors to shield user privacy without hampering their experience on third-party apps.
